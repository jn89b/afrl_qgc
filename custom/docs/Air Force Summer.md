# Air Force
[Proposal](file:///C:/Users/jnguy/Documents/phd_research/USAF_SFFP_Proposal__TPS_SUAS_Curriculum__M_Abdulrahim.pdf) 
## Ground Control Station
- RF system that communicates MAVLINK protocol
- exten QGroundControl capabilities 
- Flexibility of Matlab:
	- Command vehicle to do different things
	- Enable module 1:
		- Do frequency sweep, do something
	- How to test glide performance 
	- Set min and max speed to do specific manuever
	- Set up aircraft hardware 
	- To do command to PX4 
- Hardware 
	- Timbers
	- Pixhawk-4 
	- Here2 GPS 
	- RFD900+ 
	- Ugly sticks 
	- Virginia tech airplane
	- **Idiot proof**  
- QGroundControl
	- Extend hardware
	- Limited controls 
	- Flight test focus 
	- Customizable plots to show command response pairs
		- Command altitude vs airspeed
		- Heading, pitch angle 
		- Pitch rate 
		- Click on this to show airspeed 
		- GUI
		- Wireframe layout 
- Control
	- Sensors built into PIXHAWK
	- Supervisory controller
	- Defined by user 
	- Safety limits 
		- Bank angle
		- Airspeed
		- Position 
		- Altitude 
		- No-fly zones
- Give it to student
- Do take off
- Run some commands
- Come back and land come back to land 

## Concerns
- Workflow
	-  PX4 -> **I want to do this** 
	- QGroundControl 
- Training
